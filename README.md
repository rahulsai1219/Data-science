# Data-science
This code performs reading a raw Titanic data-set, preprocessing. handling missing values.
With the cleaned data, multiple Classification Ml algorithms are applied. Namely: Logistic Regression, SVC, KNN, Random Forest and Decision Tree.
Now applying PCA (Principle component analysis) on various dimensions of data and checking for accuracies.
Then plot for overfitting to measure which model overfits the data.
Then plot for Accurcies to understand difference in PCA and non PCA accuracies.
